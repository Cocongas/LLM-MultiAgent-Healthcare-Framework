This repository demonstrates a conceptual framework for implementing multi-agent workflows in healthcare using OpenAI's **Swarm framework**. By orchestrating multiple LLMs, this project showcases how collaborative AI agents can enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline patient management, and promote transparency in decision-making.

## üîç What is the Swarm Framework?

The Swarm framework enables seamless collaboration between multiple LLMs, each acting as a specialized agent in a complex workflow. Inspired by natural swarms, it ensures agents communicate, validate, and refine outputs to achieve better outcomes than standalone models.

In healthcare, this approach mirrors real-world multidisciplinary teams, offering potential applications in diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient communication. Moreover, we can utilize different capabilities of a variety of LLMs for each particular set of tasks.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Enables specialized LLMs to simulate teamwork in clinical scenarios.
- **Transparency & Traceability**: Logs interactions between agents, aiding in error identification and medico-legal reporting.
- **Customizable Agents**: Tailored to specific tasks like diagnosis, treatment proposals, or patient communication.
- **Example Use Case**: Includes a demo for a connections of 3 agents: Triage, diagnostics and electronic health record recording.
